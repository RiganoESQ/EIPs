## Simple Summary
An standard for issuing, using and trading intellectual property R&D tokens for public benefit - ERC20 extension

(NOT A SECURITY TOKEN)

## Abstract

Builds on the ERC20, ERC721 and oppenZeppelin CraftyTokens which leverages EIP 1046 to provide fungible tokens representing intellectual property ("IP") rights and ownership by embedding a legal agreement, specifically IP license agreement in ERC721 tokenURI.  This standard will enable issuance and trade of fungible IP rights (which have historically been only non-fungible and thereby never issued).  


## Motivation
Radically scale human advance in scientific R&D.  Moving the issuance and trade of fungible IP rights on a public ledger provides a standard way of dealing in intellectual property ownership and rights on-chain, historically handled by analogue intellectual property offices, administrators, notaries, etc. which are analogue and not enable fungibility  The Ethereum blockchain provides for atomic provenance and fungibility of information across jurisdictions.

This proposal will extend the ERC20 standard to optionally include a tokenURI parameter supporting the ERC721 standard.  Leveraging ```tokenURI``` from ERC721 which created metadata identifiers for ERC20 and EIP 1047 which refers to IPFS hash metadata from a ERC721 ```tokenURI```, we provide specific format of metadata for this use case (issuing and trading IP tokens).  The metadata includes various identifiers includes among other things the license URL, providing distinct IP token classes and types for different R&D initiatives (```Token[x]```).  Any party that engages a digital transaction enforced on the Ethereum blockchain to obtain a ```Token[x]``` has consented to the terms of the license agreement which may inclide rights including access, use, development, publishing, commercialization, value ownership etc. to Portal digital commons.   The Portal is a digital commons R&D data room in which research data + papers, communications, experimental data, code, etc. will be stored.  ```Token[x]``` provides a license to rights in Portal IP.  Transactions in ```Token[x]``` provide trade of title to such richs with title provenance atomicly tracked and enfroced on the ethereum blockchain. 

This schema is actually equally relevant to ERC20 tokens and therefore should be its own standard, separate from the ERC721 standard and EIP 1046 and EIP 1047.

Metadata is critical for both ERC721 and ERC20 tokens representing things like crypto-collectibles, gaming assets, etc. - forms of intellectual property.  Other IP assets of high value to society, e.g. rocket science engineering, clinical trial data, etc. require a legal standard similar to dealing in commodities. A legal standard for tokenURI IP licensing will provide the infrastructure support to commence issuance and global trade of IP assets.

It is more logical and easier to maintain one Token Metadata JSON Schema rather than multiple schemas contained in their own EIPs.

The standard extends the secure ERC20 token standard with legal agreement in the JSON metadata for which IP tokens can be interrogated by  for its name and for details about the assets which your tokens represent.

The EULA is a file on IPFS with a certain hash that can be viewed through a URI.  Leveraging ‘tokenURI’ from ERC721 which created metadata identifiers for ERC20 and EIP 1047 which refers to IPFS hash metadata from a ERC721 URI, we provide specific format of metadata for this use case (issuing and trading IP tokens).  The metadata includes various identifiers includes among other things the license URL, providing distinct IP token classes and types for different R&D initiatives (“Token[x]”).  Any party that engages a digital transaction enforced on the Ethereum blockchain to obtain a Token[x] has consented to the terms of the EULA and may now access and communicate through the Portal (“Token user”).   



Like traditional ERC20 tokens with a fungible `supply`, for the first time, IP rights can become fully fungible thereby allowing for direct monetization and trade of R&D (as opposed to indirect: R&D-->patent-->company-->equity in company). 1048 IP tokens will be able to represent ownership rights to a R&D initiatives valuable scientific data (e.g. clinical trials, NASA-like experiments, etc). All transactions will be public on the Ethereum blockchain incentivizing one record of scientific truth. 

Such an architecture facilitates collaboration between scientists and interested parties for desired innovations while providing trustless ownership and trade on a global basis.  

Applications are contemplated below.

This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards and builds on significant international experience in intellectual property R&D. EIP-20 and EIP-721 are insufficient because they lack legal soundness which limits ultimate market penetration.  


## Specification 
OpenZeppelin provides contracts that will implement: DetailedERC20 and MintableToken. From https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/1.0.0/crafty.html :

The EIP-1046 extension is straightforward: we'll inherit from OpenZeppelin's DetailedERC20 and add the required variable to our contract. The only difference is, once again, that we need to define an initialize method instead of a constructor, and call our base contracts' initialize methods in it.

```

import 'openzeppelin-zos/contracts/token/ERC20/DetailedERC20.sol';

contract ExtendedERC20 is DetailedERC20 {
  string public tokenURI;

  function initialize(address _sender, string _name, string _symbol, uint8 _decimals, string _tokenURI) isInitializer('ExtendedERC20', '0') public {
    DetailedERC20.initialize(_sender, _name, _symbol, _decimals);
    tokenURI = _tokenURI;
  }
}

```

```

tokenURI = _tokenURI , 

_setTokenURI
function _setTokenURI(uint256 _tokenId, string _uri) internal
Internal function to set the token URI for a given token Reverts if the token ID does not exist.

Parameters:
_tokenId - uint256 ID of the token to set its URI
_uri - string URI to assign

```

https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/token_ERC721_ERC721Token.html#_setTokenURI

the ```tokenURI``` refers to IPFS hash metadata as stated above.  We provide a specific format of metadata for this use case (fungible IP issuance and trade) which includes among other things the license URI.

This is the "ERC 1048" Metadata JSON Schema

```

The metadata license agreement should be part of the IP token issuance documentation, thereby enabling the initial set of buyers from the issuer to click a check box agreeing to the license terms.  On the secondary market, the license agreement is embedded in every IP tokens metadata which states that a party agrees to the metadata license agreement by using the IP token  or in which you obtain at least one token in which such a transaction can be proven on the ethereum blockchain. The IP ```Token[x]``` represents rights as identified in the metadata license, with transactions of IP ```Token[x]``` being transactions in such rights enforced on-chain. This is similar to markets trading contracts for commodities.

There is no limitation on transfer other than requiring the sender to have a sufficient balance.


## Rationale

The developer community supports use of the tokenURI metadata through ERC721 - Crypto Kitties, ```LAND``` in Decentraland, etc. yet these distinguishable properties, like traditional IP are non-fungible.  This proposal gives IP ownership rights the ability to be fungible, secure, legally sound and atomically tracked through building on ZeppelinOS standards (which builds on ERC20, ERC721 and EIP 1046).  We provide for an extension, which is ultimately an ERC20 extension, to embed an enforceable legal agreement in an ERC20 metadata in which transacting in an IP ```Token[x]``` is consent to the agreement, IP licensing can occur between two parties using the Ethereum blockchain for enforcement as opposed to lawyers, admins and courts.which we have extended.  including access, use, development, publishing and value ownership and any other copyright right (e.g. commercialization) through ethereum blockchain provenance guaranteeing title and execution. Copyright can be as open or closed as desired reflected in a human readable license agreement.

Like traditional ERC20 tokens with a fungible supply, for the first time, IP rights can become fully fungible thereby allowing for direct monetization and trade of R&D .

One JSON schema standard will allow for simple maintenance of this critical schema enabling fungible IP markets.

Developers, scientists and all interested parties will be able to confidently understand how to issue and trade in IP tokens on a global basis with minimal friction.  This is expected to (i) increase human bandwidth for innovation and (ii) provide a new asset class - fungible IP.


Fungible Token Identifiers

Every 1048 is identified by a unique contract address (after it is deployed).  This identifying contract address SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The contract address will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified fungible identifier for a specific copyright asset on an Ethereum chain.

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation simply extends the functionality of ERC20 tokens and is optional.

## Test Cases
IP based in scientific information of value e.g. rocket science engineering, clinical trials, etc.
