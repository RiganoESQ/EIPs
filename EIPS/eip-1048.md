## Simple Summary
An standard for issuing, using and trading intellectual property R&D tokens for public benefit - ERC20 extension

(NOT A SECURITY TOKEN)

## Abstract

Builds on the ERC20, ERC721 and oppenZeppelin CraftyTokens which leverages EIP 1046 to provide fungible tokens representing intellectual property ("IP") rights and ownership by embedding a legal agreement, specifically IP license agreement in ERC721 tokenURI.  This standard will enable issuance and trade of fungible IP rights (which have historically been only non-fungible and thereby never issued).  


## Motivation
A legal standard for tokenURI IP licensing will provide the infrastructure support to commence issuance and global trade of IP assets -to radically scale human advance in scientific R&D.  Metadata is critical for both ERC721 and ERC20 tokens representing things like crypto-collectibles, gaming assets, etc. - forms of intellectual property.  Other IP assets of high value to society, e.g. rocket science engineering, clinical trial data, etc. require a fungible, legal standard similar to dealing in commodities. Moving the issuance and trade of fungible IP rights on a public ledger provides a standard way of dealing in IP ownership on-chain.  Traditionally, IP ownership and transfer is handled by analogue intellectual property offices, administrators, notaries, etc. which requires significant overhead and does not enable fungibility  The Ethereum blockchain provides for atomic provenance and fungibility enforced on chain across jurisdictions.

This proposal will extend the ERC20 standard to optionally include a tokenURI parameter supporting the ERC721 standard.  Leveraging (i) ```tokenURI``` from ERC721 which created metadata identifiers for ERC20 and (ii) EIP 1047 which enables fungibility of ERC721 ```tokenURI```, we provide specific format of metadata for this use case - issuing, owning and trading IP as fungible tokens.  The metadata includes various identifiers includes among other things the license ```URI``` - a human readable license agreement.

Any party that engages a digital transaction enforced on the Ethereum blockchain 1048 token has consented to the terms of the license agreement which may inclide rights including access, use, development, publishing, commercialization, value ownership etc.  Transactions in ```Token[x]``` provide trade of title to such richs with title provenance atomicly tracked and enfroced on the ethereum blockchain. 

This schema is actually equally relevant to ERC20 tokens and therefore should be its own standard, separate from the ERC721 standard and EIP 1046 and EIP 1047.

 All transactions will be public on the Ethereum blockchain incentivizing one record of scientific truth. 


Applications are contemplated below.

This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards and builds on significant international experience in IP R&D. EIP-20 and EIP-721 are insufficient because they lack legal soundness which limits ultimate market penetration.  


## Specification 

```
 string public constant name = "Token Name";
    string public constant symbol = "SYM";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;  
    
contract ERC20Interface {
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint);
    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance);
    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);
    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}

    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (string: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUXkwcsAd58pPNonAPNSH16rDVqW6DrHgZi4ELijppJWR);
  }
}

```

The ```tokenURI``` refers to a legally enforceable license agreement stored on IPFS.

We provide a specific format of metadata for this use case (fungible IP issuance and trade) which includes among other things the license URI.  

This is the "ERC 1048" Metadata JSON Schema

    }
}

```


A 1048 token represents ownership rights as identified in the metadata license, with transactions of 1048 tokens being transactions in such rights enforced on-chain. The metadata license agreement should be part of the IP token issuance documentation, thereby enabling the initial set of buyers from the issuer to click a check box agreeing to the license terms.  On the secondary market, transacting in a 1048 token is consent to the legal agreement, thereby enabing IP transactions to occur between two parties using the Ethereum blockchain for enforcement as opposed to lawyers, admins and courts. This is similar to markets trading contracts for commodities.

There is no limitation on transfer other than requiring the sender to have a sufficient balance.


## Rationale

The standard extends the secure ERC20 token standard with legal agreement in the JSON metadata for which IP tokens can be interrogated by  for its name and for details about the assets which your tokens represent.  The license agreement outlining IP rights is a file on IPFS with a certain hash that can be viewed through a ```URI```.
The developer community supports use of the tokenURI metadata through ERC721 - Crypto Kitties, ```LAND``` in Decentraland, etc. yet these distinguishable properties, like traditional IP are non-fungible.  This proposal gives IP ownership rights the ability to be fungible, secure, legally sound and atomically tracked through building on ZeppelinOS standards (which builds on ERC20, ERC721 and EIP 1046).  


One JSON schema standard will allow for simple maintenance of this critical schema enabling fungible IP markets.

Developers, scientists and all interested parties will be able to confidently understand how to issue and trade in IP tokens on a global basis with minimal friction.  This is expected to (i) increase human bandwidth for innovation and (ii) provide a new asset class - fungible IP.

Like traditional ERC20 tokens with a fungible `supply`, for the first time, IP rights can become fully fungible thereby allowing for direct monetization and trade of R&D (as opposed to indirect: R&D-->patent-->company-->equity in company). 1048 IP tokens will be able to represent ownership rights to a R&D initiatives valuable scientific data (e.g. clinical trials, NASA-like experiments, etc).

Fungible Token Identifiers

Every 1048 is identified by a unique contract address (after it is deployed).  This identifying contract address SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The contract address will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified fungible identifier for a specific copyright asset on an Ethereum chain. 

Transfer Mechanism
ERC-20


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation simply extends the functionality of ERC20 tokens and is optional.

## Test Cases
IP based in scientific information of value e.g. rocket science engineering, clinical trials, etc.  Other use cases may include entertainment licensing, consumer applications, software development, etc.
