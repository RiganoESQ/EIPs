## Simple Summary
A legal standard for compliant, non-security ICOs for real world value: fungible copyright use, development and value ownership (license)



## Abstract
As per the United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit,
 
“an initiative that is primarily a means whereby participants could pool their own activities, their money and the promoter’s contribution in a meaningful way is not an investment contract.”[5]

The following standard allows for the implementation of a legally sound API for developers, scientists and interested parties to raise funds through ICO for scientific R&D for public benefit.   In exchange for ETH, instead of equity which is highly regulated or a utility token of questionable value, funders receive fungible copyright license rights including access, use, development, publishing and value ownership through ethereum blockchain provenance guaranteeing title and execution.


## Motivation
Innovation is the solution for long term prosperity.  People want innovation.   In jurisdictions where governments do not control innovation e.g. communism, innovation is often constrained by bandwidth - R&D input output frequency is too slow due to lack of efficiencies for people to pool their own activities, money and contributions in a meaningful way on a global basis to advance science and or technology.  Because of this, R&D is usually confidential around high walls leaving stakeholders without access - thereby innovation is limited.  Here we provide a legally compliant architecture to increase the rate at which R&D information and data flow happens between people to radically change human capabilities for innovation.

We provide for simple ERC-1048 legal agreement executed through smart contract which enables p2p legal title and transfer of copyright enforced on a blockchain.  Such an architecture facilitates collaboration between scientists and interested parties in R&D of a diverse universe of information assets while providing trustless ownership and transaction capacity on a global basis.  

Applications are discussed below.
This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards and builds on significant international legal and software experience in intellectual property development. EIP-20 and EIP-721 are insufficient because they lack legal soundness which limits ultimate market penetration.

## Rationale
ICOs are a unique funding method that democratizes access on a global basis, yet they lack a consistent legal standard.  Utility tokens lack users.  Copyrights are valued in the trillions of dollars, yet there is currently no liquid market for exchange of copyright due to high overhead requirements.  This limits innovation on a global basis.  By providing a legal standard for non-security ICOs, we can exponentially increase efficiencies regarding the rate at which R&D information and data flow between people to radically change our capabilities for innovation.

Intellectual property, specifically copyright is just unique information that is in a medium.  There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable information assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, Crypto Kitties, music rights in UJO, etc.  Prior to ethereum, this was essentially the job of intellectual property offices worldwide, through analogue lawyers, judges and administrators to track and enforce copyright.  Through proof of existence, ethereum enables fungible information based assets aka copyright to be atomically tracked.   Because of this, copyright can be fungibly funded, developed and traded on a global basis with minimal friction.

In exchange for funds, funders receive user tokens, allowing them to access and contribute to R&D through a digital commons portal. Through the digital commons portal, technologists and interested people can join together as a collective to fuel innovation, develop intellectual property and build a progressively greater intelligence.  As outlined below, no one participant in the portal has control.  as this architecture provides a system of checks and balances in which all portal participants can stay intimately involved. 

Specifically, developers lead technical R&D while users will be able to enjoy the fruits of the Portal R&D through direct access to research papers, communications, source code, experimental data, etc. in the digital commons portal.  Users will also have rights to publish, provide commentary, submit pull requests, contribute and mine data, and challenge capital milestone deployments, amongst others (more below).  Users are direct beneficiaries as they have access to cutting edge R&D that would otherwise likely be unavailable and controlled by few. The token serves as a participation and anti-abuse mechanism to guard the value of the collective and digital commons portal.  Everything that is done or exists in the digital commons is protected by copyright which inures to the benefit of the token holders, e.g. reports, code, experiments, data, comments, publications, etc.  In the analogue world this is usually protected by confidentiality agreements, in person relationships and/or private incentives creating significant overhead, extremely limited: access, education and communication frequency and potentially significant lack of public benefit.

Users are essentially nodes in a R&D network, collectively feeding the network with questions, answers, information, etc. serving to fuel innovation.  The more innovation, the greater the value of the copyright which thereby is expected to drive value to that user token community.

Fungible Token Identifiers
Every 1048 is identified by a unique contract address (after it is deployed).  This identifying contract address SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The contract address will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified fungible identifier for a specific copyright asset on an Ethereum chain. 

Transfer Mechanism
ERC-20


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation simply extends the functionality of ERC20 tokens and is optional.

## Test Cases
Clinical trial/biotechnology development, software development, game development
