## Simple Summary
A standard legally sound interface for fungible intellectual property licensing

## Abstract
The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard legally sound API for fungible intellectual property (“IP”) licensing using smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to mint, track and transfer IP licenses on a direct p2p basis without the traditional legal middlemen (lawyers, notaries, etc.) guaranteeing title and execution.

## Motivation
A general token legal IP framework establishes a standard for pseudo-open development which enables the direct monetization of IP (information = money) as opposed to the legacy industry indirect and silo’d way of monetization (creation/discovery → patent → create a company → sell equity in company).
The standard defines fungible title to information based assets that can then be collaboratively developed.  The creation of p2p legal title of information based assets enforced on a blockchain enables parties to collaborate in development of a diverse universe of information assets while providing trustless ownership and transaction capacity on a global basis.  
We provide for simple ERC-731 legal agreement executed through smart contract for decentralized stored information copyright. Applications are discussed below.
This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards and builds on significant international legal and software experience in IP. EIP-20 and EIP-721 are insufficient because they lack legal soundness which limits ultimate market penetration.  

## Specification
Greg to move the contents of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YM1SSfl_Dlc1SXv6vy-YGn7hFOOoPwJjS1RgI6Y27b8/edit?ts=5b8bebe9 to here

## Rationale
Intellectual property, specifically copyright is just information that is in a medium.  There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable information assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, Crypto Kitties, music rights in UJO, etc.  
Prior to ethereum, this was essentially the job of intellectual property offices worldwide, through analogue lawyers and administrators.  Ethereum enables fungible information based assets to be atomically tracked.   Because of this, IP especially copyright can be directly monetized:
Information = money, 
as opposed to the legacy system which is indirect: 
IP created → company formed → sell equity in company → company sells game 
This legal IP development standard provide less friction in global IP dev markets by increasing velocity of intellectual property rights through direct monetization.  Token holders can be paid for their contributions directly without a middleman (e.g. in exchange for contributing code to a game) through joint funding and democratized access/information rights. 
Fungible Token Identifiers
Every 731 is identified by a unique contract address (after it is deployed).  This identifying contract address SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The contract address will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified fungible identifier for a specific copyright asset on an Ethereum chain. 
Transfer Mechanism
ERC-20


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation simply extends the functionality of ERC20 tokens and is optional.
