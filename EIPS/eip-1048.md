## Simple Summary
An standard for issuing, using and trading intellectual property R&D tokens for public benefit - ERC20 extension

(NOT A SECURITY TOKEN)

## Abstract

Builds on the ERC20, 721, 1046 standards to provide fungible tokens representing intellectual property ("IP") rights and ownership by embedding a legal agreement, specifically IP license agreement in ERC20 metadata.  This standard will simplify issuance and trade of fungible IP rights (which have historically been only non-fungible).  


## Motivation
Radically scale human advance in scientific R&D.  Moving the issuance and trade of fungible IP rights on a public ledger provides a standard way of dealing in intellectual property ownership and rights on-chain, historically handled by analogue intellectual property offices, administrators, notaries, etc.  The Ethereum blockchain provides provenance and fungibility across jurisdictions.

The standard extends the secure ERC20 token standard with legal agreement in the JSON metadata for which IP tokens can be interrogated by  for its name and for details about the assets which your tokens represent.

Like traditional ERC20 tokens with a fungible `supply`, for the first time, IP rights can become fully fungible thereby allowing for direct monetization and trade of R&D (as opposed to indirect: R&D-->patent-->company-->equity in company). 1048 IP tokens will be able to represent ownership rights to a R&D initiatives valuable scientific data (e.g. clinical trials, NASA-like experiments, etc). All transactions will be public on the Ethereum blockchain incentivizing one record of scientific truth. 

Such an architecture facilitates collaboration between scientists and interested parties for desired innovations while providing trustless ownership and trade on a global basis.  

Applications are contemplated below.

This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards and builds on significant international experience in intellectual property R&D. EIP-20 and EIP-721 are insufficient because they lack legal soundness which limits ultimate market penetration.  


## Specification <-- @Bruno, why have anything more than the license agreement here?
This is the "ERC 1048" Metadata JSON Schema

```

The metadata license agreement should be part of the IP token issuance documentation, thereby enabling the initial set of buyers from the issuer to click a check box agreeing to the license terms.  On the secondary market, the license agreement is embedded in every IP tokens metadata which states that a party agrees to the metadata license agreement by using the IP token (the license as currently drafted requires the R&D lead to post all R&D information in a digital commons only accessible to token holders in which token holders gain access to researchers, research data/paper, ability to provide commentary, challenge funding deployments and have potential IP rights in access, use, publishing, development, distribution and commercialization, amongst others. etc.) or in which you obtain at least one token in which such a transaction can be proven on the ethereum blockchain. @Bruno . This is similar to markets trading contracts for commodities.

There is no limitation on transfer other than requiring the sender to have a sufficient balance.

## Rationale

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable property. Examples of existing or planned non-fungible tokens are LAND in Decentraland, Crypto Kitties, etc. yet these distinguishable properties, like traditional IP are non-fungible.  This proposal gives IP ownership rights the ability to be fungible, secure, legally sound and atomically tracked through building on the ERC20, 721 and 1046 standards.  By embedding an enforceable legal agreement in an ERC20 metadata in which transacting in an IP token is consent to the agreement, IP licensing can occur between two parties using the Ethereum blockchain for enforcement as opposed to lawyers, admins and courts.


Developers, scientists and all interested parties will be able to confidently understand how to issue and trade in IP tokens on a global basis with minimal friction.  This is expected to (i) increase human bandwidth for innovation and (ii) provide a new asset class - fungible IP.


Fungible Token Identifiers

Every 1048 is identified by a unique contract address (after it is deployed).  This identifying contract address SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The contract address will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified fungible identifier for a specific copyright asset on an Ethereum chain. 

Transfer Mechanism
ERC-20


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation simply extends the functionality of ERC20 tokens and is optional.

## Test Cases
IP based in scientific information of value e.g. rocket science engineering, clinical trials, etc.
